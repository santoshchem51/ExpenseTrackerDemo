"# ExpenseTrackerDemo" 

This is Expense tracker Restful api to support front end applications to serve data as data service. This api is currently hosted in Microsoft Azure and serves data from sample Azure sql database.

I have used entity classes, entityframework to talk to database. And used UnitOfWork and Repository design patterns. I tried to adhire Rest principles and returned correct response to all methods exposed. Used swagger to expose/test my api and below is the link for it.
